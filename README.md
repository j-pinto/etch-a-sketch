etch-a-sketch
allows user to sketch lines on a "sketchpad" in browser by moving mouse over the pad

basic logic:

set fixed width x height (1024 x 1024px ???)

html should have "container" div to hold grid

draw square grid of divs
    each grid square background color grey
    use flexbox/css grid to display as square grid array of divs
    grid array should take up full width and height
make grid draw function felxible to take variable dimension input

event listener for mouse hover over whole grid
    change that grid square's background color on mouse hover
